# Metricon Labs

Privacy layer on Solana.  
Move assets without the noise.

## Overview
Metricon Labs is a privacy-focused blockchain infrastructure project built on Solana.  
It explores secure transaction routing, vault-based architecture, and stealth-style asset movement designed for performance, discretion, and clean execution.

The goal is simple: reduce unnecessary wallet exposure while maintaining speed and usability.

## Core Features
- Vault-based transaction architecture  
- Privacy-focused routing logic  
- Swap and bridge infrastructure concepts  
- Full-stack dashboard experimentation  
- Scalable backend and Web3 integrations  

## Tech Stack
Solana • Anchor • Rust • TypeScript • Next.js • Supabase • Web3.js

## Architecture (High Level)
User → Vault PDA → Routing Layer → Destination Wallet / Bridge

Designed to minimize direct wallet-to-wallet exposure and improve transaction separation.

## Status
In active development and experimentation.  
Exploring scalable privacy infrastructure and backend architecture on Solana.
